Quick Guide
  1) Add a new "UI Soft Mask" component to your parent UI object;
  2) Hook your texture mask into "Mask" property;
  3) Make sure to mark the child UI objects as "maskable";
  4) If any object bellow the hierarchy uses a custom shader it is required to add UISoftMask support into that shader. Please check "Custom Shader Support" at documentation for more details.
